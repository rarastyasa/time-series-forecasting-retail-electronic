    Our retail electronics company operates through **three main warehouses ‚Äî Nickolson, Thompson, and Bakers.**  
    Each warehouse serves different regional markets, playing a critical role in ensuring timely delivery and efficient stock management.  

    However, fluctuating demand patterns and supply chain inconsistencies across regions have made inventory forecasting increasingly complex.  
    To address this, the company leverages **AI-driven time series forecasting** to improve accuracy, optimize stock levels, and enhance operational decisions.

    # --- Business Problem ---
    st.header("üè≠ Business Problem")
    st.markdown("""
    The company experiences **inconsistent sales performance** across its three primary warehouses ‚Äî **Nickolson**, **Thompson**, and **Bakers**.  
    Daily sales data exhibit high volatility, with frequent zero-sale days, sudden demand spikes from promotions, and occasional delays in supply.  
    This instability makes daily forecasting less reliable and difficult to apply in stock planning.

    Since **replenishment and supplier orders are managed weekly**, analyzing and forecasting data on a **weekly basis** offers a more stable and actionable view of true demand patterns.  
    Each warehouse demonstrates distinct sales characteristics:

    - **Nickolson** ‚Äî steady weekly demand with mild seasonality.  
    - **Thompson** ‚Äî high-volume but volatile due to promotions and regional dynamics.  
    - **Bakers** ‚Äî irregular and unpredictable demand, possibly linked to inconsistent local orders.

    These differences create challenges in balancing stock between locations, leading to overstock in some warehouses and shortages in others.

    st.markdown("""
    This project aims to develop **warehouse-specific weekly forecasting models** that adapt to each location‚Äôs demand behavior.  
    The main objectives are to:

    - **Improve forecast accuracy** by reducing noise from daily fluctuations.  
    - **Support better inventory planning** to minimize both overstock and stockout risks.  
    - **Capture localized demand patterns** to optimize procurement and distribution strategies.  

    By building a reliable forecasting system, the company can achieve **a more efficient supply chain**, reduce costs,  
    and ensure that product availability consistently meets customer demand across all regions.
